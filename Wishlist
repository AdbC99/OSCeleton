Use distance of joints to affect the layer's Z-index in animata. Maybe add options to send /layerpos messages based on some of the joints or based on the Z coords?
Option to use skeletal hierarchy with limb rotations instead of cartesian coordinates (for Ableton Live, blender, exporting to BVH).
Noise filtering (to reduce skeleton jerkyness).
Export to BVH animation file format.
Save and replay from ONI files (also for BVH in the future).
Viewer window option (unless we can get OSX to allow 2 processes to use the same usb device simultaneously)
Add alternative QC format (hierarchy format).
