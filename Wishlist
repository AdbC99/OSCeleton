Use distance of joints to affect the layer's Z-index in animata. Maybe add options to send /layerpos messages based on some of the joints or based on the Z coords?
Option to use skeletal hierarchy with limb rotations instead of cartesian coordinates (for Ableton Live, blender, exporting to BVH).
Noise filtering (to reduce skeleton jerkyness).
Add a message format that is easier to use in Quartz composer (/joint/head/1/pos f f f).
Viewer window option (unless we can get OSX to allow 2 processes to use the same usb device simultaneously)
